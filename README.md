# Physics* Simulation
<sup>\*kind of, right now it only simulates gravity ðŸ˜”</sup>

A simple web app which lets you add 2D boxes onto the screen and have them simulate gravity.

Try it out at [shock59.github.io/falling](https://shock59.github.io/falling/)!

 You can add boxes which are simple solid colours, but also images, YouTube videos, audio players, embeds of other websites, or even any custom HTML you want. I built this using TypeScript without any other libraries (other than Vite for development) and I hope to expand it in the future to support more advanced 2D phyiscs as well as other types of boxes you can add.
