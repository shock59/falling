# Physics* Simulation
<sup>\*kind of, right now it only simulates gravity ðŸ˜”</sup>

A simple web app which will let you add 2D boxes onto the screen and have them simulate gravity. You can add boxes which are simple solid colours, but also images, YouTube videos, audio players, embeds of other websites, or even any custom HTML you want. I built this using TypeScript without any other libraries (other than Vite for development) and I hope to expand it in the future to support more advanced 2D phyiscs as well as other types of boxes you can add.
